      <h2>How to take care of your pets</h2>
      <p>As a parent, leaving your pets at home while you are on vacation or at work can be stressful.<br> 
      Finding someone to take care of your pets may seem easy, but it can really be a 
      hassle. We all know that anyone can walk a dog or pet sit, but what if your furry friends has other need?

      <h2>This is my favourite Pet care agency.</h2>
      <p>The only place I will leave my little girl when I go away. The only issue is she doesn't want to 
        come home because she is having so much fun. The best part is the accessibility to the staff
        and pictures on Facebook of playtime. I could not feel more confident in who is taking care of my pup while being out of town.
